# Open Source Software: Where do they got their names from?

Did you ever wondered where do popular Open Source projects got their name from?
Like why is MySQL named MySQL? And not FooSQL?

This repository contains the history and reason how various Open Source projects got their name.

# Projects

## [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

> [...] The name MySQL (just like the MyISAM storage engine) comes from Monty's first daughter "My". [...]

Monty in the above quote is [Michael Widenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Widenius).

## [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)

> The 'MySQL' name is trademarked by Oracle, and they have chosen to keep that trademark to themselves. The name MySQL (just like the MyISAM storage engine) comes from Monty's first daughter "My". MariaDB continues this tradition by being named after his younger daughter.

## [Wikidata QID](https://www.wikidata.org)

> The QID which identifies a thing in Wikidata is using the letter Q as [Denny Vrandečić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_Vrande%C4%8Di%C4%87)'s wife's name starts with a Q. Denny is one of the founding members of Wikidata.

## [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

> The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. K8s as an abbreviation results from counting the eight letters between the "K" and the "s". [...]

## [cURL](https://curl.se/)

> The tool we had been working on for a while was still called urlget in the beginning of 1998 but as we just recently added FTP upload capabilities that name turned wrong and I decided cURL would be more suitable. I picked ‘cURL’ because the word contains URL and already then the tool worked primarily with URLs, and I thought that it was fun to partly make it a real English word “curl” but also that you could pronounce it “see URL” as the tool would display the contents of a URL.
>
> Much later, someone (I forget who) came up with the “backronym” Curl URL Request Library which of course is totally awesome.

## [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)

> Debian was begun in August 1993 by Ian Murdock, as a new distribution which would be made openly, in the spirit of Linux and GNU. [..]
> Debian is pronounced /ˈde.bi.ən/. It comes from the names of the creator of Debian, Ian Murdock, and his wife, Debra.
